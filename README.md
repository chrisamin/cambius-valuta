# cambius-valuta

This project is a person-to-person currency exchange intented for small communities (for instance employees of a single company) that travel a lot to places where they want to have cash at hand.
One hassle with foreign cash is that you have to both obtain it before traveling and get rid of it afterwards.
This project aims to solve this!

HOW IT WORKS
============

If you have foreign cash after a trip that you want to get rid of you register that in a web interface.
If you want to have foreign cash before a trip you visit the web interface to see if somebody in your community has that. 


HOW TO INSTALL
==============

Assuming python/pip are installed you can run

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
to get the necessary python modules installed.

After that #TODO
